## Spicy Lyrics behavior and motion reference

Countdown motion and pinned-footer options reference [Spicy Lyrics](https://github.com/spikerko/spicy-lyrics) and [iPixelGalaxy's fork](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/spicy-lyrics), reviewed at fork commit `a53a4f5aab4aa052754f9b55c3e4665f4a5e30a2`. The fork is distributed under GNU AGPL-3.0; SpotiFlex uses the same license. Its motion curves and settings behavior inform SpotiFlex's own implementation. Upstream extensions and assets are not bundled.

Local speech recognition uses [whisper-rs](https://codeberg.org/tazz4843/whisper-rs) (Unlicense), [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) (MIT), and [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) model weights (MIT). The pinned quantized English model is distributed by [the whisper.cpp model repository](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp). Model weights are downloaded into application data, verified against a pinned SHA-256, and are not tracked in this repository. Microphone audio is processed locally.

## Spotify mobile protocol investigation

DJ request research uses read-only inspection of the user's installed Spotify Android package (`com.spotify.music`, version code `147346334`, APK SHA-256 `C26E20A8CE9DB36FD0B6021542C75ABCAF4E923557B8A21058B502E295D62928`). The Spotify application is proprietary. Inspection is limited to app code and package metadata; private app data and credentials are not read. The APK and analysis output remain local ignored artifacts. No Spotify implementation code or assets are included in SpotiFlex from this inspection. Any integration must be independently written and its observed behavior verified.

The matching public ARM64 APK split and Windows Spotify 1.3.3.264 protocol schemas were also inspected locally. The DJ prompt encoder is an independent Rust implementation of observed field numbers and input values; no Spotify implementation code or assets were copied. [go-librespot](https://github.com/devgianlu/go-librespot/tree/bd3fa74), licensed under GPL-3.0, was consulted for playlist signal interoperability; its implementation was not copied.

## Kawarp

Album-cover ambience uses @kawarp/core 1.3.1 (https://github.com/better-lyrics/kawarp), the renderer used by the Spicy Lyrics reference. Its license follows.

SOFTWARE.

The native DJ list paging, advertised prompt handshake and auxiliary speech decoder are independently written from observed protocol fields and responses. No Spotify code, recordings, artwork or account response fixtures are distributed with this integration.

## librespot DJ implementation

The Playback and Connect crates are vendored at the pinned revision below. Local changes mark narration packets, reconcile local resume events with published Connect state, and include the requested queue track ID in TrackChanged events so alternative audio metadata cannot change playback identity. Their MIT licenses are preserved in both vendor directories.

Native playback uses the MIT-licensed librespot libraries, with experimental DJ session paging, mono narration and speech sequencing from [upstream pull request 1797](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/pull/1797), pinned to [School-User/librespot revision b199674d7c241eb82abce494f3f17a9d373b8d23](https://github.com/School-User/librespot/tree/b199674d7c241eb82abce494f3f17a9d373b8d23). The patch follows devgianlu/go-librespot's DJ implementation. Its license follows.
